# Fun With Asynchronous code

This repository is a part of my "fun with" series. Each and every day I challenge myself to learn something new. Once I feel like I understand a subject well enough to move onto the next one, I build a small proof of concept or example so that I can reference it in the future. It also has the double benefit of serving as a great learning resource for my Bootcamp students.

My bootcamp students were asking for some clarification on async javascript. So I built this exploration of the several glorious ways to handle async code!

*Please note that these examples are mostly written in ES5 as not to confuse my students (they have not learned ES6 syntax yet).

## Included Examples

- Callbacks
- Promises 
- Converting Callbacks to Promises
- Async/Await
